/*
 * Problem:
 * Given a string str consisting of opening and closing parenthesis '(' and ')'. Find length of the longest valid parenthesis substring.

	A parenthesis string is valid if:
	For every opening parenthesis, there is a closing parenthesis. Opening parenthesis must be closed in the correct order.
	Examples :
	Input: str = ((()
	Output: 2
	Explaination: The longest valid parenthesis substring is "()".
	
	Input: str = )()())
	Output: 4
	Explaination: The longest valid parenthesis substring is "()()".

/*
* Approach:
* Stack Initialization:

	A stack stack is initialized and a value of -1 is pushed onto it. This serves as a sentinel value to handle edge cases.
	Iteration:
	
	The code iterates through each character in the input string str.
	For each character:
	If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', its index i is pushed onto the stack.
	If the character is a closing parenthesis ')':
	The top element is popped from the stack.
	If the stack is not empty, it means there's a corresponding opening parenthesis, and the length of the valid substring is calculated as i - stack.peek(). 
	This length is compared with the current maxLength and updated if necessary.
	If the stack is empty, it indicates an unbalanced parentheses sequence, so the current index i is pushed onto the stack.
	Maximum Length Calculation:
	
	After iterating through the entire string, the maxLength variable holds the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.
	Explanation:
	
	The stack is used to keep track of the indices of opening parentheses.
	When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the top index is popped to check for a corresponding opening parenthesis.
	If a corresponding opening parenthesis is found, the length of the valid substring is calculated.
	The -1 sentinel value helps handle cases where the first character is a closing parenthesis or there's no valid parentheses substring.
