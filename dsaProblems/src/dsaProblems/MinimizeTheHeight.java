/*
 * Problem:
 * Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.
	For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.
	
	Increase the height of the tower by K
	Decrease the height of the tower by K
	Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.
	
	You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
	Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array should not contain any negative integers.
	
	Examples :
	
	Input: k = 2, arr[] = {1, 5, 8, 10}
	Output: 5
	Explanation: The array can be modified as {1+k, 5-k, 8-k, 10-k} = {3, 3, 6, 8}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 8-3 = 5.
	Input: k = 3, arr[] = {3, 9, 12, 16, 20}
	Output: 11
	Explanation: The array can be modified as {3+k, 9+k, 12-k, 16-k, 20-k} -> {6, 12, 9, 13, 17}.The difference between the largest and the smallest is 17-6 = 11. 
	Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logn)
	Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

/*
 * Explanation:
	Initial Difference: The difference between the tallest (arr[n-1]) and the shortest (arr[0]) is calculated initially.
	Adjustments:
		The smallest possible height can be obtained by either increasing the smallest element by k or 
		decreasing a larger element by k (ensuring no negative values).
		Similarly, the largest possible height can be obtained by either decreasing the maximum tower by k or increasing the smallest element by k.
	Skip Negative Heights: If decreasing by k results in a negative height, we skip that iteration.
	Iterating and Minimizing: As we iterate, we compute the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum heights that can be achieved after adjusting each tower.
