/*
 * Problem:
 * Given two strings s and p. Find the smallest window in the string s consisting of all the characters(including duplicates) of the string p.  Return "-1" in case there is no such window present. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index.
	Note : All characters are in Lowercase alphabets. 
	
	Examples:
	
	Input: s = "timetopractice", p = "toc"
	Output: toprac
	Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest
	substring in which "toc" can be found.
	Input: s = "zoomlazapzo", p = "oza"
	Output: apzo
	Explanation: "apzo" is the smallest 
	substring in which "oza" can be found.
	Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|)
	Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n), n = len(p)
	
	Constraints: 
	1 ≤ |s|, |p| ≤ 105

/*
 * Sliding Window:
	The sliding window is moved to the right by incrementing r.
	For each character in the window, its frequency is incremented in winFreq.
	When the window contains all characters of p (checked using the isSubString function), the window is shrunk from the left by incrementing l.
	During the shrinking process, the minimum window length is updated if a smaller window is found.
